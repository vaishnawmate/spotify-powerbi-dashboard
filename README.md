# spotify-powerbi-dashboard
Designed and developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze trends in popular Spotify songs using a provided dataset.

Performed data cleaning and transformation in Power Query to handle missing values, correct data types, and prepare the dataset for analysis.

Created key visualizations, including line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots, to identify trends in streams over time and the correlation between song attributes like danceability and energy.

Implemented slicers and filters to provide dynamic, user-driven analysis, enabling deeper insights into artist and year-based performance.
